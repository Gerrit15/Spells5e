  "text": "This spell requires 30 feet of cord or rope, which is consumed by the spell. While you cast this spell, you use the cord or rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on a flat surface within your reach. When you finish casting, the cord or rope disappears to become a magical trap.\nThe trap is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.\nThe trap triggers when a Small creature or larger moves into the area protected by the spell. The triggering creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and be hoisted into the air until it hangs upside down 3 feet above the protected surface, where it is restrained.\nThe restrained creature can make a Dexterity saving throw with disadvantage at the end of each of its turns and ends the restrained effect on a success. Alternatively, another creature that can reach the restrained creature can use an action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained effect also ends.\nSpell Lists. Artificer, Druid, Ranger, Wizard",
