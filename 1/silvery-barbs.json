You magically distract the triggering creature and turn its momentary uncertainty into encouragement for another creature when a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself succeeds on an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw. The triggering creature must reroll the d20 and use the lower roll.\nYou can then choose a different creature you can see within range (you can choose yourself). The chosen creature has advantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes within 1 minute. A creature can be empowered by only one use of this spell at a time.",
