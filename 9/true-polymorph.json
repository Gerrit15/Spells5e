If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation becomes permanent.\nShapechangers aren't affected by this spell. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn't affected by this spell.\nThis spell can't affect a target that has 0 hit points.",
