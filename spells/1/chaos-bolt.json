Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.\n1 - acid, 2 - cold, 3 - fire, 4 - force, 5 - lightning, 6 - poison, 7 - psychic, 8 - thunder\nIf you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.\nA creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.",
