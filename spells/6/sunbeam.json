On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.\nYou can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.\nFor the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight.",
