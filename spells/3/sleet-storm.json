The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.\nThe ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spellâ€™s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.\nIf a creature starts its turn in the spell's area and is concentrating on a spell, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.\nSpell Lists.
