In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesnâ€™t function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.\nYou instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:\nFor example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any nearby towns.",
