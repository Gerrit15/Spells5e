Otherwise, the spell has no effect on it. A target is also unaffected if it is immune to being charmed.\nWhile the target is affected by crippling pain, any speed it has can be no higher than 10 feet. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, other than Constitution saving throws. Finally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted.\nA target suffering this pain can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the pain ends.",
