You affect it in one of the following ways: \nYou instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location\nYou cause simple shapes—such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location—to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour\nIf you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action",
