You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before.\nThe duration depends on the object’s material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.\nVegetable matter: 1 day, Stone, crystal: 12 hours, precious metals: 1 hour, gems: 10 minutes, adamantine, mithral: 1 minute\nUsing any material created by this spell as another spell’s material component causes that spell to fail.",
