  "text": "You call forth an undead spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Undead Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose the creature’s form: Ghostly, Putrid, or Skeletal. The spirit resembles an undead creature with the chosen form, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\nThe creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger\nUndead Spirit: Medium Undead\nArmor Class: 11 + the level of the spell (natural armor)\nHit Points: 30 (Ghostly and Putrid only) or 20 (Skeletal only) + 10 for each level of the spell above 3rd\nSpeed: 30 ft., fly 40 ft.
