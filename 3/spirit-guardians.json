If you are evil, they appear fiendish.\nWhen you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creatureâ€™s speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.",
