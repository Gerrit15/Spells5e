Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as three other targets, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by only one of the bolts.\nA target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.",
