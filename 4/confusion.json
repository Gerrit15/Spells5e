Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.\nAn affected target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.\n1: The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn’t take an action this turn\n2-6: The creature doesn’t move or take actions this turn\n7-8: The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn\n9-10: The creature can act and move normally\nAt the end of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.",
